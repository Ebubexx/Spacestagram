      <p class="p1">It's easy to get lost following the intricate, looping, twisting filaments in this detailed image of
        the supernova remnant Simeis 147. Also cataloged as Sharpless 2-240, it goes by the popular nickname, the
        spaghetti Nebula. Seen toward the boundary of the constellations Taurus and Auriga, it covers nearly 3 degrees
        or 6 full moons on the sky. That's about 150 light years at the stellar debris cloud's estimated distance of
        3,000 light-years. The supernova remnant has an estimated age of about 40,000 years, meaning light from the
        massive stellar explosion first reached Earth 40,000 years ago. But the expanding remnant is not the only
        aftermath. The cosmic catasrophe also left behind a sinning neutron star or pulsar, all that remains of the
        original star's core.</p>

      <p class="p1">What does Comet Leonard look like up close? Although we can't go there, imaging the comet's coma and
        inner tails through a small telescope gives us a good idea. As the name implies, the ion tail is made of ionized
        gas - gas energized by ultraviolet light from the Sun and pushed outward by the solar wind. The solar wind is
        quite structured and sculpted by the Sun's complex and ever changing magnetic field. Following
        the wind, structure in Comet Leonard's tail can be seen to move outward from the Sun even alter its wavy
        appearance over time. The blue colour of the ion tail is dominated by the recombining carbon monoxide molecules,
        while the green colour of the coma surrounding the head of the comet is created mostly byy a slight amount of
        recombining diatomic carbon molecules.</p>
